#   bl-imgur-upload: script to take screenshots and upload them to Imgur; this
#   can be to an existing account, or anonymously.
#
#   Credentials and an access token for an account can be set up.
#
#   Settings (imgur.conf) and credentials (credentials.conf}) files are created in
#   ${HOME}/.config/image-upload/imgur/
#
#   The script returns BB-Code for the direct image link, and a linked thumbnail.
#   YAD dialogs are used for user interaction.
#
#   There is an option to upload a file directly from the file manager, and the
#   BBCode placed on the clipboard.
#
#   Kudos to the writer of the script at https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot,
#   which has provided most of the OAuth2 and Imgur API functions adapted here.
#   ("imgur-screenshot" is featured in https://imgur.com/tools.)

USAGE="bl-imgur-upload is a script to take screenshots and upload them to Imgur
this can be to an existing account, or anonymously.

Usage:    bl-imgur-upload [option]... [file]...

With no script args, ${SCRIPT} will upload a screenshot of
the full desktop, as anonymous user.

Arguments:
  -h, --help                   Show this help, exit
  -l, --login                  Upload to Imgur account
  -c, --connect                Show connected Imgur account, exit
  -r, --register               Register for Imgur account
  -s, --select                 Take screenshot in select mode
  -w, --window                 Take screenshot in active window mode
  -f, --full                   Take screenshot in full desktop mode
  -d, --delay <seconds>        Delay in integer seconds, before taking screenshot
  -a, --album <album_title>    Upload to specified album
  -t, --title <image title>    Label uploaded image
  --file  <filepath/filename>  Upload specified image. Overrides scrot options
  --auto-upload                Upload image from filemanager, put BBCode on clipboard
  --test-account               For use by external command, to see if user
                               has an Imgur account already

The final dialog displays forum BB-Code for both the direct image link and
the linked image thumbnail. These can be copy/pasted as desired.

If more than one of '-f','-w', or '-s' are passed to the script, the LAST
one will be used.

There is an option to delete uploaded and/or local screenshot images
before exiting the script. This doesn't apply if using '--auto-upload'.

'imgur.conf' settings, such as filepaths and image format, can be changed
by editing the file directly.
