Notes on bl-exit version 2.0

1. This version does not use options any more. It uses one single postional argument.

   This means

        bl-exit --logout

   now becoemes

        bl-exit logout

   Users that have changed thei main menu to call bl-exit directly from the menu
   will have to remove the two leading dashes when this version is released.

   bl-exit -h

   or

   bl-exit --help

   work as before and explain the new argument usage.

2. I have implemented all remarks from twoion, except splitting the
   package in a python module and a python executable script.

   Debian has special 'rules' for building such packages.
   See source package for 'mirage' as an example.

   Now bl-exit is part of bunsenlabs-utilities, which has diffdeerent 'rules'
   for building the package.

   My suggestion is to cut bl-exit out of bunsenlabs-utilities and make a new package
   'bunsenlabs-exit', a package containing only bl-exit, or maybe a package
   'bunsenlabs-python-utilities' to group current and coming python packages.

   What do you think?
