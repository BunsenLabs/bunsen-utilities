README

blobthemes: script to save or restore openbox gui configurations

(Requires yad, wmctrl, xdotool, xrandr, nitrogen|feh, scrot)

Save options are for  Conky(s)
                      Tint2(s)
                      Openbox theme
                      GTK theme
                      Background (uses Nitrogen or feh, depending which
                                  has the newer saved bg config file)
                      Alt Menu (dmenu)
                      Lightdm login gtk greeter
                      Terminator config

Paths are assumed to be BunsenLabs defaults.

WARNING: It is assumed that the conkys are not being run via a script, so 
they will appear on all desktops. If you usually use a script, then you 
may have to make your own arrangements! Conkys in non-default directories
can be saved, but will not be seen when running bl-conkyzen.

A Screenshot is saved (Windows are hidden briefly so the image
                       is the bare desktop, with any Tint2s 
                       or Conkys which are running, and a representive
                       menu and lxappearance open)

A time-stamped backup of rc.xml is saved "just in case". 

The dialog icon is "Bunsenlabs-flame-256.svg": put it in /usr/share/pixmaps.

xdotool is used to move the mouse pointer, and assumes the root-menu is shown.
with "Super + Space" keys, and the right mouse button is set for r-click.
If you have set these to something else, then edit the "MENUMODIFIER" and
MOUSECMD variables. Set the variable "KEYDOWN" to where "Preferences" is
in the root-menu (or anything else you might want displayed).

****************************************************************************
KNOWN ISSUES:
Virtualbox does not allow the guest to move the host mouse cursor, using xdotool,
so the screenshot may produce an incorrect theme displayed and/or poor positioning.
A workaround is to move the cursor to some free space, and use the "Enter" key in the
"Configurations to be saved:" dialog.
